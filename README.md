# OntoPix: Aplicando SABiO para modelagem conceitual bem fundamentada das jabuticabas financeiras brasileiras

OntoPix is a well-founded domain ontology, specified in OntoUML, that formally represents relevant spaces of current brazilian finance, more specifically its transfers and economic exchanges that use the Pix payment method. The purpose of the ontology is to clariy such domain-relevant concepts and relationships and produce a ontologically well-founded conceptual artifact.

## Future Work
* We're in the late stage os modeling concepts definitions such as Chave Pix, Taxes and Tarifs
* We're now in the early stages of modeling concepts such as Pix Withdrawal, Pix Exchange and Limits.
* We will soon update with a machine-processable version of OntoPix in formats such as owl and RDF
